T: well, it is a fantastic experience.
V: that's good! So you like it, do you?
T: of course! 
V: so did you use a teamwork-driven communication tool like flockr before?
T: yea, I think DingDing is similar to flockr.
V: ok that's great, compared with Dingding, is there any features flockr does not have but dingding does?
T: let me have a think......well actually there exists one
V: what is that?
T: well in dingding, when two people wanna say something private rather than in a channel, they can add friends and start a private text box.
   but when I was using flockr, I did not find this function.
V: oh yea! you are right, we do need to add a making friend feature, it is important! thx a lot for this valuable advice!!!
T: no worries, it is so glad to help you.
V: our team member will implement it asap, once it finished, I will invite you to experience again!
T: that's great!

R: Right, here is the web link and you can experience it.
(after half an hour)
D: Well, I have experienced all features I can, it is a fantastic.
R: That’s good! So you like it, do you?
D: Not really. Compared with other APPs such as WeChat and Facebook, there are many features Flockr does not have but other does.
R: Yes, we know, that’s why you suggestions are important. Can you give me examples?
D: OK, for example, in Flockr, when I want to add strangers as friends, it’ hard, cause I don’t know their ID. However, in WeChat, I can. I can add some strangers through people nearby feature.
R: You are right, so we can add people nearby feature to let user add friends randomly. It’ a good idea! What about others?
D: Another thing I think is message send feature. Sometimes, I am driving and I can’t do typing. So voice send or voice transfer could be important.
R: Yes, I mean you idea, this is important feature we need to have. I will discuss with my teammates later and try to achieve them. Once it finished, I will invite you to experience again!
D: That's great!
